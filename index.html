While at heart a caring and nurturing individual, her positive aspects are often offset by her many shortcomings.Her famous and symbolic moves includes "drilling" others head with her fists (known as "guri-guri") and a series of punches on the head, creating comically large lumps (the punches are mainly thrown by Misae.She loves to splurge on Himawari and herself. She always changes her hair styles as seen it is sometimes curly and sometimes long and shattered hair.She is the source of boundless diet and savings plans, all of which fail within the first week However, she buys in extreme quantities, which defeats the purpose.

She can't talk.She is similar to her mother.She possesses a palpable lust for shiny objects.In her family she is an icon of adoration and annoyance, causing trouble she cannot be blamed for - given her infantile innocence. She is naughty and very active. She can crawl extremely fast which tires out even Shin-chan, and often uses Shiro as a toy. Her name means "sunflower", which are occasionally seen on her clothing and toys. Her name was chosen by drawing in episode 204-2. The winner of that draw was Shin-Chan, who had chosen this name for her.</p>
